## Case Study :clipboard:

Department of Computer Science UET Lahore holds committee for management of
final year project. Each year, list of project titles is opened for the students by the
committee after the compilation of ideas from the faculty members. Students are
privileged to form the group and select any of the ideas from the list after approval
from the faculty advisor. Once the project is selected by a group of students, an
advisory board is assigned to the project which consists of main advisor, co-advisor,
and industry advisor. Throughout the year, multiple evaluations are taken against
the project. Currently, this process is managed through spread sheets. You are
supposed to streamline the above process that will be operated by the member
of project committee to manage data at one place. Following features will be
implemented in the application:

* Manage Students
* Manage Advisors
* Manage Projects
* Formation of Student Group and its management
* Assignment of project to a group of students
*  Assignment of multiple advisors to the project
*  Manage Evaluations
* Mark the evaluations against a group 

And any other feature that can be helpful for the management of final year projects after discussion with the committee. Final year project committee also requires multiple reports in pdf form that may include:

* List of projects along with advisory board and list of students
* Marks sheet of projects that shows the marks in each evaluation against each student and project

any other reports that you can help the committee to streamline the process.

## Collaboration :heavy_check_mark:

Collaboration in the above case study involved working with Mr. Nazeef Ul Haq,
who was the instructor for the project. Mr. Nazeef Ul Haq provided the case
study and explained the schema and database for the project. As the developer
of the project, I collaborated closely with Mr. Nazeef Ul Haq throughout the
development process.



## Conclusion

The Final Year Project Management System will provide an efficient way for the
Department of Computer Science at UET Lahore to manage final year projects.
The system will help streamline project management by providing features such as
student and advisor management, project management, student group formation,
project assignment, evaluation management, and marking. The system will also
generate reports in PDF format for easy access to project information. The system
can be extended to include additional features such as project progress tracking,
resource allocation, communication tools, and project budget management.
